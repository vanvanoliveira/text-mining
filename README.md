Data Mining and Machine Learning Project
This project demonstrates the application of data mining techniques to analyze textual data. The main focus is on text preprocessing and the Bag of Words (BoW) model, which converts textual information into a numerical format for machine learning.


Overview 
The goal of this project is to preprocess and analyze a dataset of tweets to extract meaningful insights using machine learning techniques. The project involves:
Text cleaning and preprocessing (tokenization, removing contractions, etc.).
Visualization using word clouds.
Bag of Words (BoW) model for feature extraction.
